# Coderslang: Become a Software Engineer

This VSCode extension is a companion for the **Full Stack JS** course [**CoderslangJS**](https://js.coderslang.com).

At the moment we support two languages which are **EN** and **RU**.

## Learn Javascript

If you want to learn Full Stack Javascript development you’re in the right place.

We’ll start by building a strong **core JS knowledge**. You can start here if you have **zero prior programming experience** as we’ll work very carefully to now overload you with new material.

Then we proceed to building backends in **Node.js** and **Express.js**, deploying them to the remote servers with **Docker**. You’ll also learn to operate on a **Linux** operating system as most web servers run on it.

The frontend path begins with learning the basics of **HTML** and **CSS** and moves on to creating modern single page applications with **React.js**.

The mobile development course teaches you all about the cross platform development for **iOS** and **Android** using **React Native**.

Eventually, we’ll get to a point where you’re ready to be hired as a **Full Stack JS Engineer** or build your own startup. To make sure don’t reinvent the wheel, we’ll have a deeper dive into vanilla JS once again. 

We’ll learn **Algorithms**, **Data Structures** and **Principles of Software Development** and finalize your education with the **Technical Interview Preparation**.

Don’t hesitate, and [start learning now](https://js.coderslang.com)!

## How do I start learning

The **Coderslang** VSCode extension allows you to get practical tasks from our server and solve them.

You learning path starts in the browser, so you should head to [js.coderslang.com](https://js.coderslang.com) if you haven’t already.

There, you’ll get an **API key** that you’ll enter into the extension settings.

Once you’re authenticated, you can download available tasks and submit them. The system will verify your solution and tell you the result of submission in a couple of seconds.

If you’ve solved the task correctly, you can move on to the next one.

If not, then you’ll see a list of issues that your program has. You should fix them and resubmit the solution.
